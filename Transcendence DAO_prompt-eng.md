Transcendence DAO - Collective Economy Prototype
Project Summary
EcoSolidarity is a decentralized application based on the principles of Das Kapital, which tokenizes nature conservation and social solidarity activities. Users earn SOLIDARITY (SOL) tokens in exchange for real-world aid activities (disaster relief, environmental protection, elderly care, etc.) and participate in a collective economic system.

    // Overwork check
    if working_hours > 8 { return true; }
    
    // Low wage check
    if wage_ratio < MINIMUM_WAGE_RATIO { return true; }

Collective Tokenomics - Anti-Capitalist System
1. Progressive Decay System
Token Decay Rate = (Token Amount / Median Balance) × 0.05
Purpose: To prevent the accumulation of wealth

Mechanism: The tokens of those who have excess tokens decrease over time

Fairness: Increasing decay rate for every token above the median

2. Universal Basic Income (UBI) System
Daily UBI = 10 SOL (To all active users)
Funding: Decayed tokens + platform revenue

Condition: Minimum of 1 activity per week

Purpose: To meet basic needs

3. Wealth Cap
Maximum Token = Median × 10
Exceeding Condition: Excess tokens are automatically sent to the collective treasury

Transparency: All transfers are public

Democratic Control: The community can intervene on the cap by voting

4. Mandatory Redistribution
Monthly Redistribution = (Total Tokens × 0.02) / Number of Active Users
Source: 2% deduction from all balances

Distribution: Equally to all active users

Fairness: Continuous redistribution cycle

5. Social Contribution Multiplier
Token Value = Base Value × (1 + Social Score/100)
Social Score: Social contribution score

Factors: Frequency of help, peer evaluation, sustainability

Purpose: To reward contribution, not money

Anti-Exploitation Algorithms
1. Sybil Attack Protection
Identity Verification: Phone + ID verification

Activity Patterns: AI-based detection of fake activities

Geographic Limits: Control for excessive activity in the same location

2. Automation Detection
Time Analysis: System for detecting very fast transactions

Behavioral Analysis: Detection of non-human patterns

Penalty System: Token confiscation for fake activities

3. Geographic Fairness
Regional Token Distribution = (Regional Need × 0.6) + (Population × 0.4)
Purpose: To balance the advantage of developed regions

Mechanism: Higher token rewards in less developed regions

Fairness: To eliminate geographical inequality

Democratic Governance
1. Liquid Democracy
Direct Voting: User votes on every issue

Delegation: Delegating authority to expert users

Revocable: Delegation can be canceled at any time

Topic-Based: Different delegates for different topics

2. Consensus Mechanisms
Proposal System: Anyone can make a proposal

Deliberation Period: 72-hour discussion period

Voting: Quadratic voting (√token amount)

Implementation: Automatic smart contract execution

3. Transparency
Public Ledger: All transactions are transparent

Impact Reports: Regular impact reports

Open Source: The code is completely open source

Community Audit: Audited by the community

Economic Sustainability
Revenue Sources
Transaction Fees: 0.1% platform cut

Premium Features: Advanced analytics, priority visibility

Partnerships: NGOs, municipalities, international organizations
