# Transcendence DAO - Work Log

## Project Overview
Transcendence DAO (EcoSolidarity) is a decentralized application based on Das Kapital principles that tokenizes nature conservation and social solidarity activities. Users earn SOLIDARITY (SOL) tokens for real-world aid activities and participate in a collective economic system.

     - Activity creation and peer verification system
     - Strike support and worker cooperative modules
     - DAO governance with quadratic voting
     - Anti-capitalist tokenomics (UBI, progressive decay)
     - All required data structures and error handling
   - Updated Cargo.toml configurations for modern Solana toolchain
5. **Build Issues Encountered**: Working on resolving SBF compilation issues
6. **Angular Frontend Complete**:
   - Created new Angular project `frontend` with strict settings and SCSS

   - Implemented `solana.service.ts` for blockchain interaction and wallet management
   - Implemented `transcendence-dao.service.ts` for handling smart contract interactions
   - Created complete dashboard component with:
     - Wallet connection/disconnection functionality
     - User profile creation and display
     - Mock data for testing (tokens earned, activities, etc.)
     - Feature cards for future modules (Activities, Strikes, Cooperatives, DAO)
   - Added responsive styling with Collective/solidarity theme (red colors)
   - Successfully builds and compiles
7. **Smart Contract & Frontend Integration**:
   - Fixed smart contract compilation errors (variable borrowing, function signatures)
   - Created IDL (Interface Definition Language) file for frontend integration
   - Attempted Anchor framework integration but encountered browser compatibility issues
   - Implemented simplified Web3.js integration structure
   - Ready for deployment once smart contract is compiled to SBF successfully
8. **Activities Module Implementation**:
   - Created complete Activities component with full functionality
   - Implemented activity registration form with categories, location, and GPS
   - Added activity verification system with peer-to-peer validation
   - Created responsive UI with activity cards and status tracking
   - Integrated navigation from dashboard to activities module
   - Users can now register activities and verify others' contributions

### Key Project Components Identified:
- **Backend**: Solana blockchain using Anchor Framework (Rust)
- **Frontend**: Angular 20 with Material/Tailwind CSS
- **Token System**: SOLIDARITY (SOL) tokens with anti-capitalist tokenomics
- **Core Features**: Activity verification, DAO governance, strike support, worker cooperatives

### Technical Stack:
- **Blockchain**: Solana Mainnet/Devnet
- **Smart Contracts**: Anchor Framework (Rust)
